Arena Club is a site that will help gamers to find new friends and new ways to enjoy the game. This website will target younger gamers. We target young gamers because they may not have many friends and at a young age. It is crutical to have friends and people to look up to. I aim to create a site for boys between 12-19 years old. They come to Arena-club to find new friends and find new way of playing the game. When they sign up they will recive a Discord invite and a clan invite for the game to join with. The reason why they will come back to the site is to see if there are any new updates or new channels to join. 

# Features.

# Future Left to Implement-
I would like to give all the buttons and links a hover effect.
Try out some other fonts colors and font styles.
Create a discord channel and start a clan!

# Testing
Testing of the site went well. I tried to move around in the navigation bar without any difficulty. 
I tried to submit the form without filling in the blanks wich didin´t work. So i hade to fill in form first and when i press submit it takes me back to Index.html as i planned. I tried the anchors for youtube, instagram and facebook wich created a new tab aswell and took me to the correct website.
I also run the websites in lighthouse. Im a bit dissapointed in the "Perfromance" But i know it´s because of the big images.
